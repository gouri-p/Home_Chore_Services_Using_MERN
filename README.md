# Home_Chore_Services_Using_MERN
Simple beginner MERN project.

This project mainly concentrates of providing a platform to get a temprary job to local people without mediator.

There are 2 main module:

Client- who is in need of home chore related services like cleaning, repair, etc.
Worker- Who provides services as per Client's requiest.

I have used MERN stack to build this project.
